Pod Debugging and Troubleshoot:
1: imagePullBackoff
  invalid image name
  invalid tag
  invalid permissions
2: ErrImagePull
3: RegistryUnavailable
4: CrashLoopBackOff
5: KillContainerError

Image Pulled but pod is pending:
Resource Quota on Namespace
Nodes does not have the required resource quotas
Check Kube-Scheduler components

Image is Pulled but pod is not ready:
always check for the readiness probe

CrashLoopBackOff:
Liveness Probe Failure
it is live for public sand working fine without any issues and restarting if there any issues
Application failed to start for any reason

Kubernetes Events :
1: kubectl logs pod : kubectl logs mypod
2: kubectl describe pod
3: kubectl get events:
kubectl get event --namespace abc-namespace --field-selector involvedObject.name=my-pod-zl6m6

Tail Logs: kubectl logs -f mypod
OOM Killed: Out Of Memory Killed
Limit OverCommit Exceeded
Container Limit Exceeded
Resource Quotas: Requests and Limits
kill -3 PID

What are the pod status:
1: Pending --> Pod is scheduled and all conatiners ready and started working will go to running
2: Running --> All containers are started and serving the requests
3: Succeeded --> When the containers is exited with success
4: Failed --> When the containers are exited with error
5: Unknown --> When the pod is unknown (usually node issues)

How to Trouble shoot when the pod is in pending state:

Why pod is Pending State:
1: Insufficient Resources (You dont have enough resources)
2: Taints on Nodes
3: Node Affinity / Pod Affinity
4: Node Selectors
5: Dependency Management
6: Image pull Problem
7: Init Conatiner are not completed properly
8: Pods are using Host ports

Step By Step Trouble Shoot:
1: Check in the scheduling state
2: Check the image download
3: Chcek the dependencies
4: Check the node details about resources and allocatable memory
5: Check the PVC is created properly and attached it to pod
6: Check the Secrets and Config maps are attached
7: Check the replication controller why it has not able to create a pod

Commands need to be executed:
1: kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}
2: kubectl get pod -o wide
3: kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Pending
4: kubectl get events | grep ${podname}
5: kubectl describe node | grep tainted
6: kubectl describe rc ${repication controller name}

How to Troubleshoot pod in waiting state:
1: If the image you have given is incorrect
2: make sure that image is pushed to image registry
3: try to pull the image manually to check the image is present in registry or not

My pod is running but it is not doing what i expected --> Due to missed information in yaml file
# kubectl apply --validate -f mypod.yaml.

How to trouble shoot a service:
1: Service provide a load balancing across the pods
2: For every service object in k8s that api server will makes endpoints
3: kubectl get endpoints ${service name}
