## Python DSA Notes

**What is DSA:**
- Data Structures : Study of methods for storing and organizing the data in a formal structure is called Data Structuring
- Algorithims: When we use some sequence of steps to organize and storing the data is called Algorithims

## What is Time Complexity:


### Asymptotic Analysis
- No dependency in machine,programming language,CPU Cycles etc..
- We Do not have to implement all the ideas/algorithims
- Asymptotic Analysis is measusing the order of growth in the form of input sizes.
- Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
