## Python DSA Notes

## What is Time Complexity:


### Asymptotic Analysis
- No dependency in machine,programming language,CPU Cycles etc..
- We Do not have to implement all the ideas/algorithims
- Asymptotic Analysis is measusing the order of growth in the form of input sizes.
- Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
